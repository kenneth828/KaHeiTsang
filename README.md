Hi there 👋 I'm KaHeiTsang

## About me 
I am a Software Engineering graduate with hands-on experience building scalable data pipelines, real-time analytics systems, and hardware-accelerated computer vision applications.


## I am currently working on:
SQL Data Warehouse Project 
- Built a modern data warehouse using SQL Server and Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems (ERP and CRM).
- The project features end-to-end ETL pipelines that extract data from CSV files, perform data cleansing and quality checks in the Silver layer, and transform it into a star schema in the Gold layer optimized for analytics.
- Implemented fact and dimension tables to enable SQL-based reporting and dashboards, delivering actionable business insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Projects:
# Data Pipeline Benchmarking Framework for Edge Video Analytics using yolov5s
-Built during my Software & Data Engineering internship at Anders Electronics (Sep 2023 - Sep 2024), this platform benchmarks YOLOv5 object detection across CPU, NPU, Coral Edge TPU, and Hailo-8 accelerators.

Key Achievements:

- 🚀 10× throughput improvement using hardware acceleration
- ⚡ Sustained >60 FPS at <5W on edge devices
- 📊 14+ platforms tested: ARM/x86, iMX8/iMX93, Fitlet, Coral Dev Board

-Tech Stack
Python • OpenCV • TensorFlow Lite • PyTorch • Docker • GStreamer • Coral TPU • Hailo-8 • NPU
