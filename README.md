Hi there 👋 I'm KaheiTsang

## About me 
I am a Software Engineering graduate with hands-on experience building scalable data pipelines, real-time analytics systems, and hardware-accelerated computer vision applications.


## I am currently working on:
SQL Data Warehouse Project 
- Built a modern data warehouse using SQL Server and Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems (ERP and CRM).
- The project features end-to-end ETL pipelines that extract data from CSV files, perform data cleansing and quality checks in the Silver layer, and transform it into a star schema in the Gold layer optimized for analytics.
- Implemented fact and dimension tables to enable SQL-based reporting and dashboards, delivering actionable business insights for data-driven decision-making.
